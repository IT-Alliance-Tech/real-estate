By instructing Real Estate to pay another User, the Users authorize and order Real Estate to make the payments (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Agreement) to such User. Real Estate may limit the recipient's ability to use or withdraw the committed funds for such period of time that Real Estate has agreed to with the recipient.<br/><br/>

3. Fees: The User agrees that they may be charged a service charge by Real Estate for using the Site to make rental payments or payment of security deposits.<br/><br/>

4. Transaction Limits: Real Estate may delay, suspend, or reject a transaction for any payment for any reason, including without limitation if Real Estate suspects that the transaction subjects it to financial or security risk, is unauthorized, fraudulent, suspicious, unlawful, in violation of the terms of this Agreement, subject to dispute, or otherwise unusual.<br/><br/>

5. Chargebacks: The amount of a transaction may be charged back or reversed to the User (a "Chargeback") if the transaction: <br/>
(i) is disputed by the sender; <br/>
(ii) is reversed for any reason; <br/>
(iii) was not authorized or Real Estate has reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized; or <br/>
(iv) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of this Agreement. <br/>
The Users owe Real Estate and will immediately pay Real Estate the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties assessed by Real Estate, the Processor, processing financial institutions, or MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, and other payment card networks, associations, or companies ("Networks"). The Users agree to assist Real Estate when requested, at the User's expense, to investigate any of the User's transactions processed through the Service. For Chargebacks associated with cards, Real Estate will work with the Users to contest the Chargeback with the Network or issuing banks should the User choose to contest the Chargeback; in this regard, Real Estate will request necessary information from the User to contest the Chargeback and the User's failure to timely assist Real Estate in investigating a transaction, including without limitation providing necessary documentation within 6 business days of Real Estate's request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.<br/><br/>

6. Liability: The Users agree not to hold Real Estate responsible and/or liable for any issue or claim arising out of any dispute whatsoever between the User and the Processor and/or the User and the User's bank or financial institution. Additionally, Real Estate shall not be responsible for any additional fees or charges deducted by the Processors while processing payments in connection with the User's transaction and Real Estate disclaims all liability in this regard. Further, the Users may also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by such Processors and the Users should review these terms and conditions before authorizing any payments through the Processors.<br/><br/>

7. Fraud and Restrictions: Real Estate may ask for additional documents (like Rental Agreement, Owner/Tenant PAN, Maintenance Bill) where it deems necessary, including in case the transaction looks suspicious. Real Estate will refund the full amount (excluding the nominal processing fees collected by Real Estate) without any deductions if Real Estate determines it is not a valid rent/token/security deposit/maintenance payment or if such payment is fraudulent. A valid rent/security deposit payment is one where there exists a legally valid rental agreement between the tenant and the landlord with the rent amount equivalent to what is being transferred on Real Estate Pay. A valid maintenance payment is one where there exists a maintenance bill between the payer and the society/RWA.<br/><br/>

8. Refunds: In case Real Estate is not able to facilitate transfer of the rent amount to the beneficiary account due to any technical difficulties, Real Estate will refund the payment back to the source. The Users are advised not to transfer the rent directly to the landlord until a refund ID is generated and sent to the Users via email and SMS. Refunds will be processed within 15 working days and credited to the customer's original payment method, subject to respective bank timelines.<br/><br/>

9. Risk Acknowledgement: The Users acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of the User's access to and use of the payment Services remains with the Users. If the Users permit or authorize another person to use their Real Estate account in any way, the Users shall be responsible for the actions taken by that person. Neither Real Estate nor any other party or Processor involved in creating, producing, or delivering the payment Services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data, or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure, or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these payment terms.
